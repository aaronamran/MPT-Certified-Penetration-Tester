# MPT-Certified-Penetration-Tester
The MCSI Certified Penetration Tester is not the typical theory, rote-memorisation, multiple-choice questions exam type of certification. Instead, it is a 100% practical, self-paced and self-discovery certification designed for applying hands-on skills needed for penetration testing and offensive security right from the start.

In this repository, the Security Tools, unofficial OSCP bundle and CCT ACE bundle are included. Note that there may be some overlapping of documentations, because some of the tasks (and security tools) for each syllabus are the same. Each domain has its own individual folder in this GitHub repository, and activities related to each domain are documented and saved as .md files within their respective folders.

This GitHub repository is intended to document key lessons learned during the MCSI Certified Penetration Tester certification for personal reference and future use, as well as to serve as part of a portfolio for job applications.
