# Lab Setup: Software Development
A well-configured software development environment (SDE) is essential for programmers to efficiently write, test, and debug applications. It includes tools, programming languages, and IDEs that support versatile development across projects and platforms, enabling effective problem-solving and system integration

## Tasks
- Download and install the following software:
  - Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
  - Python
  - Ruby
  - Microsoft PowerShell
  - A C compiler, such as GCC
  - XAMPP server
- Create the following scripts:
  - A Python script that prints the version of Python to the console
  - A Ruby script that prints the version of Ruby to the console
  - A PowerShell script that prints "Hello World" to the console
  - A simple C program that prints "Hello World" to the console (Compile the C program using the installed C compiler)
  - A PHP script that displays the version of PHP installed on your system
 
## Benchmarks
- Execute the Python script to verify the correct Python version is displayed
- Execute the Ruby script to verify the correct Ruby version is displayed
- Execute the PowerShell script to print "Hello World" to the console
- Execute the binary compiled in C to print "Hello World" to the console
- Ensure that the XAMPP server is running correctly on your machine
- Include your PHP script in the XAMPP "htdocs" directory
- Browse to the PHP file hosted on the localhost (127.0.0.1) to verify the correct PHP version is displayed
