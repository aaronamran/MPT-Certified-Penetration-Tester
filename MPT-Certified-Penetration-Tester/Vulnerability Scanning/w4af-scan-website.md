# Use W4AF To Scan A Website For Vulnerabilities
W4AF is a Web Application Attack and Audit Framework. It can help automatically find security vulnerabilities in web applications while developing and testing applications

## Tasks
- Install the w4af docker image
- Install the Damn Vulnerable Web App (DVWA) docker image
- Configure W4AF to scan the DVWA website for critical vulnerabilities
- Analyze the scan results and select two (2) vulnerabilities from the report for manual validation
- Manually exploit the selected vulnerabilities to verify their existence and potential impact

## Recommended Approach
- Start by downloading and running the W4AF Docker image (references)
- Download and run the Damn Vulnerable Web App (DVWA) Docker image (references)
- Once the Docker containers are running, use the ifconfig command within the DVWA container to identify its IP address. Note down this IP address as you will need it for scanning
- Configure W4AF to scan the DVWA website by specifying the IP address obtained in the previous step as the target
- Enable the "web spider" and "dir brute forcer" plugins in W4AF to ensure comprehensive scanning
- Set the W4AF audit profile to "full_audit" for a thorough vulnerability assessment
- Provide the necessary DVWA credentials to the W4AF scanner to enable authenticated scanning
- Set the target in W4AF as the identified IP address of the DVWA host (localhost and 127.0.0.1 will resolve to the local container)
- Initiate the vulnerability scan using W4AF and allow the scan to complete
- Analyze the scan results provided by W4AF and identify vulnerabilities returned by the scan
- Demonstrate manual exploitation of the identified vulnerabilities
- When receiving the error "The remote web server is not answering our HTTP requests" when scanning 127.0.0.1 or localhost, it is due to running docker container 127.0.0.1 and localhost will resolve locally and not the host address. Find the IP of your host machine and set this as the target instead
