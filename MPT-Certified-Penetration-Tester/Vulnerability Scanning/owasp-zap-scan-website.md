## Tasks
- Download and install OWASP ZAP on your computer
- Set up a VM and host a vulnerable web application on it, eg: Damn Vulnerable Web App (DVWA)
- Run OWASP ZAP and perform a vulnerability scan on the vulnerable website
- View the identified vulnerabilities on the target website
- Select one vulnerability identified by OWASP ZAP
- Manually exploit the vulnerability

## Benchmarks
- Validate that OWASP ZAP has detected vulnerabilities on the target website
- Validate that one of the detected vulnerabilities on the target website was manually exploited
